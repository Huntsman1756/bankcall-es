# BankCall España

**BankCall España** provides reproducible, entity-level historical financial
statements for Spanish banks from Banco de España public XBRL data, with
temporal legal-entity identity, taxonomy evolution and source-level
provenance.

```console
$ bankcall compare 0049 0081 0128 --period 2026Q2 --concept "patrimonio neto"
                                    Compare — 2026Q2

## Commands

```bash
bankcall ingest                                   # build data/*.parquet (offline, once)
bankcall entity 0073                              # reporting-slot ownership history
bankcall statement 0049 --period 2026Q2 --statement balance
bankcall history 0049 anticipos --from 2020       # time series per dimension combo
bankcall compare 0049 0081 0128 --period 2026Q2   # cross-entity, same period
bankcall changes 0049 --from 2025Q2 --to 2026Q2   # diff with taxonomy-drift flags
```

Statement groups: `balance` (2701–2703), `pnl`/`pl` (4701, 4702), `equity`
(6794), `cashflow` (7701), `branches-eee` (2310), each with a `-cons`
consolidated variant (e.g. `balance-cons`), or raw statement ids. Periods:
`2018Q1`, `2026Q2`, a bare year, or raw `YYYYMM`.

## Sample output

**`bankcall compare`** — same facts, three reporting slots, one period:

![bankcall compare](docs/assets/compare.svg)

**`bankcall entity 0073`** — a reporting slot is not a legal entity:

![bankcall entity](docs/assets/entity.svg)

**`bankcall changes`** — fact-level diff with taxonomy-drift flags:

![bankcall changes](docs/assets/changes.svg)

## A bank code is not a legal entity

`0049` is a **reporting slot**, not a company. When the slot changes legal
owner — a documented transfer in the official register — the CLI warns and
segments the series instead of silently splicing it:

```console
$ bankcall entity 0073
  Reporting slot 0073 — legal owner per period
   Period  Raw key     Legal entity      Status
   2018Q1  0073(0002)  OPEN BANK, S.A.   active
   ...
   2026Q2  0073(0002)  OPEN BANK, S.A.   active
  warning: slot 0073 changed legal owner — OPEN BANK, S.A. (until 202506)
  -> OPEN BANK, S.A. (from 202606), official handoff 2026-05-04. Series
  below is segmented; it is NOT one continuous legal entity.
```

9,253 unique slot-to-entity mappings and 8 documented ownership transfers
were extracted and validated in the identity layer (see below).

## Facts are dimensional — nothing is silently aggregated

Every fact carries its dimensional qualifiers (MCI line item, MCY scope,
BAS, APL, ...). `history` returns **one series per dimension combination**;
`statement` lists raw facts with member labels resolved; `changes` flags
facts whose concepts drifted between taxonomy generations
(`STRUCTURALLY_CHANGED`, `RENAMED_EQUIVALENT`, `NEW`, `REMOVED` — from the
G1-C concept mapping). Ambiguous concept names fail closed.

## Methodology and provenance

The corpus underneath this CLI was produced by a reproducible evidence
phase:

| Phase | Scope | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| G0 | Acquisition of the official BdE corpus | `g0-acquisition-green` |
| G1-A | Catalog discovery, deterministic | PASS |
| G1-B | Hypothesis "bank code = legal entity" | **falsified** by evidence |
| G1-BR | Corrected model: slot + valid time -> legal entity | PASS (9,253 mappings, 8 transfers) |
| G1-C | Taxonomy versioning, concept mapping, semantic drift | PASS (`g1-c-taxonomy-pass`) |
| G1-CR | Corrected revalidation of G1-C (collision-aware normalization) | PASS with corrected mapping |
| G1-D | Integration: 9 contract gates, 10 periods, 117/117 XBRL | PASS (`g1-green`) |
| G1-DR | Revalidation of G1-D over the corrected mapping | `REVALIDATED_PASS_WITH_CORRECTED_MAPPING` |

- 117 official XBRL instances, 10 reference periods (2018Q1 – 2026Q2),
  ~197,700 facts ingested.
- Three BdE public-statement taxonomy generations fingerprinted and mapped
  concept-by-concept; 66 non-equivalences detected, none silent.
- Evidence and the code-to-evidence chain: `evidence/g1/`,
  `G1-REPORT.md`, `G1-C-PROVENANCE.md`, `G1-CR-REPORT.md`,
  `G1-DR-REPORT.md`.
- The G1-B falsification is preserved in `G1-REPORT.md` — the corrected
  temporal-identity model is a feature of this product, not a footnote.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
bankcall ingest   # requires the local frozen corpus (see below)
```

Requires Python >= 3.11.

## Configuration and data layout

`bankcall` resolves its inputs relative to a corpus root and writes its data
products to a data directory:

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BANKCALL_ROOT` | current directory | root of a corpus checkout (`g0_acquisition/`, `evidence/g1/`) |
| `BANKCALL_DATA_DIR` | `$BANKCALL_ROOT/data` | where `data/*.parquet` is read/written |

Run commands from the repository root, or set `BANKCALL_ROOT` to point at it.

## The frozen corpus

`bankcall ingest` needs the frozen evidence corpus, which is intentionally
**not committed** (hundreds of MB of official files; every artifact is
SHA-256-pinned in `evidence/g1/`):

- `g0_acquisition/xbrl_instances/` — 117 official XBRL instances
- `g0_acquisition/dts_mirror/` — frozen taxonomy mirror
- `evidence/g1/dts-fingerprints.json` — generated by the G1-C pipeline

### Rebuilding the corpus

The corpus is reproducible from the public Banco de España source by running
the G1 evidence pipeline in order (live network access; see each script's
docstring):

```bash
python scripts/g1/discover_catalog.py        # catalog inventory (2 clean runs)
python scripts/g1/xbrl_resolve.py            # download + hash-pin instances
python scripts/g1/identity_lifecycle.py      # slot -> legal entity mapping
python scripts/g1/validate_identity_model.py # documented ownership transfers
python scripts/g1/taxonomy_freeze.py         # hash-pin the DTS mirror
PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python scripts/g1/taxonomy_g1c.py  # fingerprints + mapping
python scripts/g1/g1d_integrate.py           # aggregate evidence + report
bankcall ingest
```

Taxonomy mirror prerequisites (`dts_mirror`, the EBA packages and the
Wayback-recovered EBA CRR dictionary) are described in
`scripts/g1/taxonomy_freeze.py` and `scripts/g1/fetch_eba_crr_wayback.py`.
